# NASA Exoplanet AI Suite - Streamlit Deployment Requirements
# Core dependencies for the Streamlit application

# Core Streamlit Framework
streamlit>=1.28.0

# Data Manipulation and Analysis
pandas>=2.0.0
numpy>=1.24.0

# Machine Learning Libraries
# Note: Models were trained with scikit-learn 1.7.1, but 1.7.2+ should work
scikit-learn>=1.7.0
joblib>=1.3.0
xgboost>=1.7.0
lightgbm>=4.0.0

# Data Visualization
plotly>=5.17.0

# File Handling and Utilities
# pathlib is built-in for Python 3.4+, no need for pathlib2

# Standard Library (included with Python)
# pickle - built-in
# warnings - built-in

# Optional: Enhanced Streamlit Components (uncomment if needed)
# streamlit-option-menu>=0.3.6
# streamlit-aggrid>=0.3.0
# streamlit-plotly-events>=0.0.6

# Development and Testing (optional - uncomment for development)
# pytest>=7.0.0
# black>=23.0.0
# flake8>=6.0.0

# Deployment Notes:
# - All models have been tested and work with these dependencies
# - Models use: LightGBM (Kepler, K2), XGBoost (TESS), HistGradientBoosting (104-input)
# - Version warnings are expected due to model training with older scikit-learn version
# - For production deployment, consider pinning exact versions for reproducibility
